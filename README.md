## Personal Identity
### jonobr1

This project is used to be the whiteboard for my personal identity on the web and other places. It's used a convenient place to version and open up the process to identify myself.

The folder structure is mostly for web, but worth describing for those interested in poking around:

+ `a/`: is for assets. All things that comprise the process of coming up with public facing, well, assets. Logos, audio files, videos, images, whatever.
+ `c/`: all css documents
+ `i/`: all images in their final format

Enjoy :)
