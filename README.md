## GIMME Branch

__gimme__ branch represents an inspiration blogging platform built on [gimmebar](http://gimmebar.com/). To preface, the description of gimme bar from the creators:

> Don’t bookmark the web. Save it. Gimme Bar doesn’t just keep bookmarks; it stores items in your personal library in the cloud. You can even back things up to [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/).

With that said, this code aims to elucidate a particular collection to my own domain as a research / inspiration blog. If you can't tell from the submodules this is built with [require](http://requirejs.org/), [jquery](http://jquery.com/), [underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/), and [backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) for maximum web application-ness. Don't be frightened, fork away :)
